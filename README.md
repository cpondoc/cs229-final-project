# Seeing Through the Facade: Leveraging Machine Learning to Classify AI-generated and Real Life Images
By: Chris Pondoc, Joey O'Brien, and Joey Guman

## Motivation:
Recent research in natural language processing and computer vision has shown progress in image generation from text. Projects such as DALLE-2 and Stable Diffusion are examples of models that have been trained on large language datasets and can create photorealistic images, transfer styles from one image to another, and process complex queries. For some, generative models amplify human creativity by serving as a tool that supercharges the creative processes. However, many others feel that developments will only lead to more problems, such as troubling deepfakes, the replacement of human artists by artificial intelligence, and disinformation that can be more quickly created and disseminated.

Thus, in the context of these malicious application, our project aims to build a binary classifier between real and generative images. In practice, our work could be applied to help tag disinformation and deepfakes around the Internet. During the process, we will employ various methodologies, including building our convolutional neural network (CNN), using transfer learning to catalyze state of the art architectures, and deconstruct generative adversarial networks (GANs).
